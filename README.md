# 🖥️ Cybersecurity Homelab

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my **cybersecurity-focused homelab** built on a **mini-PC** running **Proxmox**.  
The goal is to create a complete environment to:
- Host useful services (NAS, DNS filtering, cloud storage, firewall, etc...)
- Experiment with tools and network configurations
- Build a lab for security testing and attack analysis
- Practice on vulnerable machines

## 🛠️ Current Components
- **Proxmox VE** – main hypervisor
- **TrueNAS** – centralized NAS storage
- **Pi-hole** – network-wide DNS filtering
- **Nextcloud** – personal cloud storage for courses and files
- **Test VMs** – temporary machines for experimentation

## 🛡️ Pi-hole Blocklists

Here are the blocklists currently configured on my Pi-hole for enhanced ad and tracker blocking:
